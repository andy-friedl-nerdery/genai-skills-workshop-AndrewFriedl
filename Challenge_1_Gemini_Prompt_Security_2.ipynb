            "*   1 ½ teaspoons baking powder\n",
            "*   1 teaspoon salt\n",

            "**For the Cake:**\n",
            "1.  **Preheat & Prep:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, or line the bottoms with parchment paper.\n",
            "2.  **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.\n",
            "3.  **Combine Wet Ingredients:** In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined.\n",
            "4.  **Combine Wet & Dry:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix on low speed with an electric mixer (or by hand) until just combined. Do not overmix!\n",
            "5.  **Add Hot Liquid:** Carefully pour in the hot water (or coffee) and mix until the batter is smooth. The batter will be thin, this is normal!\n",
            "6.  **Bake:** Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out with only moist crumbs attached.\n",
            "7.  **Cool:** Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10-15 minutes before inverting them onto a wire rack to cool completely. Make sure they are fully cooled before frosting!\n",
            "\n",
            "**For the Chocolate Buttercream Frosting:**\n",
            "1.  **Cream Butter:** In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the softened butter on medium speed until light and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes).\n",
            "2.  **Add Dry Ingredients:** Gradually add the sifted powdered sugar and cocoa powder to the butter, beating on low speed until combined, then increase speed to medium and beat until smooth.\n",
            "3.  **Add Liquid & Vanilla:** Pour in the heavy cream (or milk) and vanilla extract, and add a pinch of salt if desired. Beat on high speed for another 2-3 minutes until the frosting is light, fluffy, and spreadable. If it's too thick, add more cream a tablespoon at a time. If too thin, add more powdered sugar a tablespoon at a time.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Assemble the Cake:**\n",
            "1.  **Level (Optional):** If your cake layers have domed tops, you can use a serrated knife to carefully level them for a flatter surface.\n",
            "2.  **Frost:** Place one cake layer on your serving plate. Spread a generous amount of frosting evenly over the top.\n",
            "3.  **Stack & Finish:** Carefully place the second cake layer on top. Frost the top and sides of the entire cake with the remaining buttercream.\n",
